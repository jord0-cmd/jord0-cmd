**Systems thinker. AI orchestrator.**
Three decades across 20 disciplines — from a Vic-20 to neural networks.

### The Through-Line

Every system I've ever maintained — diesel electric plants, radio repeater networks, building automation, AI infrastructure — was training data for the next one.

I don't write code. I **orchestrate intelligence**, combining three decades of domain knowledge with the most capable AI models ever built.

```
  7  First program on a Vic-20 — BASIC, the beginning of everything
 18  Electronics technician — circuit analysis, signal theory
 22  BCIT Automation — PLCs, SCADA, industrial control
 25  Coast Guard marine engineer — icebreakers in the Arctic
 30  Radio tech — helicopter deployments on frozen mountaintops
 35  DevOps engineer — infrastructure at scale
 40  AI developer — building BC's first government AI system
 now Building tools at the intersection of what's possible
```

### What I Build

Building AI-powered tools and Claude Code skills that make development workflows smarter. Currently focused on:

- **AI Orchestration** — directing multiple AI models with domain expertise, not just prompts
- **Claude Code Skills** — open-source plugins for the Claude Code ecosystem
- **Computer Vision** — YOLO pipelines, real-time inference, edge deployment
- **Creative AI** — image generation workflows, multi-model collaboration

### Tech Stack

```python
languages   = ["Python", "Rust", "TypeScript"]
ai_models   = ["Claude Opus", "Gemini Pro", "Local LLMs via Ollama"]
infra       = ["Docker", "FastAPI", "Linux", "WSL2"]
hardware    = ["Multi-GPU networks", "RTX 5070 Ti", "Edge devices"]
philosophy  = "The medium changes. The discipline doesn't."
